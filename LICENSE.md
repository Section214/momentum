Notwithstanding the above, or anything else contained in this Agreement, neither party's liability for death or personal injury resulting from its own negligence shall be limited. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

### f) Infringement

Section214 and its subsidiaries are free to use this information in any form that does not personally identify you.

### h) Personal Information

Section214 may render this License Agreement null and void if it finds that the personal information submitted during online activation or when buying Momentum is incorrect, inaccurate or outdated.
