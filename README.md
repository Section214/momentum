Momentum isn't just another AMP stack. Sure, it's a powerful development environment that can be used for basic web development, but it's so much more. It's flexible, it's elegant, and it can be configured to do virtually anything you can imagine! Momentum is built on Electron and is designed to be hackable. Designed from the ground up to be user-friendly enough for a novice, but powerful enough for collaborative work environments, Momentum is the last environment you'll ever need!
